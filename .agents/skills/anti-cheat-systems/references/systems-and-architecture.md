# Systems And Architecture

## Major Anti-Cheat Systems

### Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)
- Multi-component architecture with service, driver, and game-facing protections
- Process integrity verification and memory inspection
- Runtime driver loading with strong client-side enforcement
- Used by: Fortnite, Apex Legends, Rust

### BattlEye
- Kernel driver plus service and game module coordination
- Handle protection, process monitoring, and memory scanning
- Strong focus on injected code and runtime tampering visibility
- Used by: PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, DayZ

### Vanguard (Riot Games)
- Boot-start kernel driver with early visibility into later-loaded drivers
- Boot-time initialization
- Driver allowlisting and aggressive system trust checks
- Used by: Valorant, League of Legends

### FACEIT AC
- Kernel-level competitive anti-cheat with strong process and driver monitoring
- Emphasis on platform integrity and low tolerance for hostile drivers
- Often discussed alongside Vanguard in kernel anti-cheat research

### Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)
- User-mode detection
- Signature-based scanning
- Delayed ban waves
- Used by: CS2, Dota 2, TF2

### Other Systems
- **PunkBuster**: Legacy FPS anti-cheat
- **FairFight**: Server-side statistical analysis
- **nProtect GameGuard**: Korean anti-cheat solution
- **XIGNCODE3**: Mobile game protection
- **ACE (Tencent)**: Chinese market protection

## Anti-Cheat Architecture

### User-Mode Components
- Process scanner
- Module verifier
- Overlay detector
- Screenshot capture

### Kernel-Mode Components
- Driver loader
- Memory protection
- System callback registration
- Hypervisor and driver trust detection
- VAD and executable memory inspection

### Hypervisor-Level Components
```
- EPT-based memory access monitoring
- Callback list write protection via EPT hooks
- ETW structure integrity enforcement
- AC driver code page protection (prevent patching)
- VMCALL interface for policy configuration from kernel driver
- VM exit handlers for EPT violations on protected regions
```

### Server-Side Components
- Statistical analysis
- Replay verification
- Report processing
- Ban management
