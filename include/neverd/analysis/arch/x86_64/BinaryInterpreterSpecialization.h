/// Specialize a linked x64 interpreter at the image's mapped addresses.
/// The execution contract fixes mappings and permissions, excludes concurrent
/// code/data mutation and external calls, and requires bytecode reads to come
/// from immutable file-backed mappings. This is source recovery, not a binary
/// replacement or an exception/unwind equivalence certificate.
/// Complete PE inputs require loader-owned preferred-base snapshot evidence:
/// full DIR64 fields and ordinary import write footprints are validated;
/// IAT reads, additional loader writers and changed mappings are refused.
/// MaxImagePreparationBytes/Records bound that authentication and return
/// BudgetExceeded on exhaustion. This does not prove ASLR or initialization
/// equivalence. Native relation checks use the same fresh image evidence.
/// Ordinary ABI return behavior is required: every external-origin store's
/// target range, including addresses computed from external integers, is
/// disjoint from the entry return-address slot. This is an environment
/// precondition, not a consequence of absent frame provenance. Root-derived
/// writes must prove disjointness; stack pivots and return dispatch are
/// refused in the default mode. ExplicitMachineState admits provider-certified
/// near calls and exact returns; NormalNonfaultingExecution excludes exception
/// dispatch rather than claiming its equivalence. X64CetDisabled certifies
/// RDSSP destination preservation, never arbitrary CET instruction support.
/// Optional EntryFrameBounds restrict the physical entry root to a nonwrapping
/// interval; they do not authorize memory accesses. Native relation checks
/// require exactly matching bounds in their explicit frame contract.

/// undefined-effect coverage only when no feasible execution reaches the trap.
/// A feasible trap violates the nonfaulting contract; no resumption is modeled.

/// CET-disabled x64 profile and a readable/writable frame disjoint from the
/// immutable image. Frame must be rooted at entry RSP and contain [0, 8).
/// The checker additionally proves entry RSP and the entry return slot are
/// restored on every outer return, before the final native return-address pop.

/// alignment must match Options. Alignment restricts only the shared entry
/// root; it does not rewrite its value or supply memory/ABI evidence.
/// Selecting UserX64NoFaultV1 explicitly enables shared, persistent
/// PUSHFQ/POPFQ system state, canonical entry flag bits and mandatory final
/// system-state equality. Every POPFQ must satisfy the TF/AC restriction in
/// both executions. Exact provider-marked CET-disabled RDSSP projections and
/// unreachable INCSSP #UD boundaries retain Missing sidecars and require
/// separate profile receipts; feasible INCSSP always violates the nonfaulting
/// contract. No other CET operation is authorized. Otherwise only Contract's
