/// Local types read from C or C++ declarations: structures, unions and
/// enumerations with their members, typedefs, and the prototypes of
/// functions, laid out as the compiler of the library's data model would.
/// A user's declarations and the headers NeverD ships read alike, and so
/// does what the renderers write, so a type converts from C to any language
/// they render and back.
///
/// Every builtin spelling the renderers write is read: ULONG, unsigned int,
/// unsigned long and uint32_t.  #pragma pack, __declspec(align),
/// DECLSPEC_ALIGN and alignas set packing and alignment;
/// _Static_assert and static_assert of sizeof and offsetof are checked
/// against the layout.  Other preprocessor directives are ignored but for
/// macros that name a single word.
