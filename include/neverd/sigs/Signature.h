/// Core data types for FLIRT-compatible function signature matching.
///
/// A signature pattern consists of:
///   - Leading bytes with a mask (fixed bytes vs wildcards)
///   - CRC16 checksum over trailing bytes for verification
///   - One or more function name associations with offsets; several names
///     at one offset are aliases, the linkage names one routine has
///   - Optionally, the routines the function branches to directly
///
/// The current loader accepts the text representation of these records.  A
/// PatternModule is one record as a value; a StoredModule is the same record
/// packed into arrays that a large signature set shares.
