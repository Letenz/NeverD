/// A signature states the bytes a function has in every image it is linked
/// into. A relocated byte holds a placeholder in the object and an address in
/// the image, so it is written as a wildcard, and the CRC stops at the first
/// one because a checksum cannot express a wildcard. Everything therefore
/// depends on knowing exactly which bytes each relocation rewrites.
///
/// Names are the linkage names the object's symbol table spells, byte for
/// byte: `?Close@CFile@@UEAAXXZ`, `_ZNSt6thread4joinEv`, `_memcpy`. They are
/// never demangled, sanitized, prefixed, or truncated, so a match names a
/// routine the way its own library does.
