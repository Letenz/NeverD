"""A binary file opens as the processor its bytes name.

The worker's own executable -- headers, code and data -- with its ELF magic
cleared, so no header describes it: identification must settle the
processor it was built for, and opening it as a binary file without a
processor must read it as that one and keep it as detected.  A Cortex-M
vector table names Thumb and where the code runs.  Exits 77 (skip) on a
host processor the model does not cover.
