"""A file no header describes opens as the load dialog places it.

Writes x86-64 code under a firmware image's usual name, which EVM tools give
their bytecode too, and checks the engine does not guess either: the file
opens only with a chosen loader.  Opened as a binary file at the address the
user chose, it is browsed -- listing, functions, references and a control
flow graph from its decoded instructions -- while analysis refuses it, since
nothing states its calling convention.  The engine keeps the choice with the
input, so the next open reads the file the same way unasked.

Runs against the real engine; the bytes are analyzed, never executed.
