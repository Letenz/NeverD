# Guest process emulation

`neverd emulate` executes an image under an explicit guest OS profile. CPU
transport, image parsing, process entry and OS services have separate owners.
Build with `NEVERD_ENABLE_CPU_EMULATION=ON`; driver emulation also includes it.

The first profile, `linux-elf64-v1`, runs bounded little-endian x64 and AArch64
ELF `ET_EXEC` and self-relocating static `ET_DYN` programs at CPL3 or EL0.
It loads real ELF segments, constructs
the initial stack, resumes instruction quanta and handles explicit Linux
system-call requests. It is a freestanding process model, not a full Linux
distribution or a promise to run arbitrary libc binaries. Dynamic linking,
signal delivery, Linux process threads, general file systems and unsupported services fail
explicitly. The [Android native profile](android-native-emulation.md),
`android-aarch64-api28-v1`, separately supports bounded API 28 ARM64 shared-library
function calls and Bionic models. The Windows PE64 process profile is described
below. The [Darwin profiles](darwin-emulation.md) add bounded macOS, iOS device
and iOS Simulator Mach-O processes. Android managed runtimes and guest kernel
workloads remain separate work.

<!-- i18n-section: cli-sdk -->

## CLI and SDK

```bash
neverd emulate guest.elf --profile=linux-elf64-v1 \
  --options='{"backend":"auto","arguments":["guest","argument"],"environment":["MODE=test"],"instruction_limit":100000}'
```

Matching Linux hosts select KVM, matching Windows hosts select WHP, and
matching macOS hosts select HVF. Other
host/guest ISA combinations use Unicorn. An unavailable selected backend is an
error, with no silent fallback. An ELF guest still uses the Linux process model
when executed on Windows. See [CPU execution](cpu-execution.md) for the checked
instruction inventory, native availability and cancellation limitations.
Instruction support follows the selected checked CPU contract; vector register
storage does not imply unrestricted SIMD execution.

The CLI emits one JSON report. Its exit code is 0 for a guest exit status of
zero, 2 for another guest exit status, 3 for incomplete execution (including
faults and limits), and 1 for invalid setup/API failure. The actual guest status
is in `exit_status`; it is not substituted for the CLI exit code.

The additive C entry point is
[`neverd_emulate_process_json`](../include/neverd/sdk/NeverDCAPIProcess.h).
Pass a session, nonempty input path, explicit profile and optional options JSON.
Free its result with `neverd_free_string`. A null result is a setup failure;
read `neverd_last_error`. A guest fault or resource stop returns a report. The
session's loaded analysis image is neither required nor changed.

Python exposes the same native validation:

```python
report = session.emulate_process(
    "guest.elf", "linux-elf64-v1",
    '{"backend":"unicorn","arguments":["guest"],"environment":[]}',
)
output = bytes.fromhex(report["stdout_hex"])
```

<!-- i18n-section: options-results -->

## Options and results

Options are a JSON object of at most 64 KiB. Unknown fields, null field values,
invalid types, embedded NULs in strings and nonpositive limits are rejected.

| Option | Default | Contract |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `backend` | `auto` | `auto`, `unicorn`, `kvm`, `whp` or `hvf` |
| `arguments` | Input filename | Complete argv, including argv[0]; empty selects the default |
| `environment` | `[]` | Explicit guest strings; never inherits the host environment |
| `instruction_limit` | 100000 | Shared admitted instruction attempts |
| `event_limit` | 10000 | System-call events; charged before OS service handling |
| `timeout_microseconds` | 5000000 | One monotonic deadline starting after process setup |
| `memory_limit` | 67108864 | Physical/mapped memory budget |
| `stack_size` | 1048576 | Page-aligned stack within the memory budget |
| `output_limit` | 1048576 | Combined captured stdout/stderr bytes |
| `instruction_quantum` | 1024 | Admission interval before yielding to the runtime |
| `linux_time` | Absent | Explicit clock observations and optional idle advancement for Linux ELF64 and Android native workloads |
| `linux_files` | Absent | Closed catalogue of immutable guest files for Linux ELF64 and Android native workloads |
| `linux_signals` | Absent | Explicit initial signal dispositions; no signal delivery or host handlers |
| `linux_priority` | Absent | Explicit per-task nice values and caller authority for raw Linux priority services |
| `linux_kernel` | Absent | Explicit released GKI branch, fixed guest task catalogue or observed absent guest kernel interfaces |

`schema_version` is 1. Results include profile, architecture, selected backend
and its selection reason, `stop_reason`, nullable `exit_status`, diagnostic,
entry/current PC, instruction/event counters, service records and the last
typed CPU exit. Addresses, syscall numbers, argument registers and raw return
bits are hexadecimal strings **without** a `0x` prefix; they never lose bits
through a JSON floating-point consumer. `stdout_hex` and `stderr_hex` are
lowercase byte encodings, preserving NUL and invalid UTF-8. A null syscall
result denotes no modeled return, including process exit or an unsupported
request; it is distinct from a successful zero return.

<!-- i18n-section: linux-semantics -->

## Linux profile semantics

`writev` shares those sinks on x64/ARM64 and through Android Bionic. It imports up to 1024 guest `iovec` entries before output, rejects negative lengths with `EINVAL`, validates user ranges, and applies Linux’s page-aligned transfer cap. An invalid descriptor returns `EBADF` before vector access; inaccessible metadata returns `EFAULT` without output. A later payload fault preserves the copied prefix. The output budget covers the whole vector before publication, across both streams. `write` and `writev` use the low 32 descriptor bits; vector count also follows Linux’s 32-bit import. Bionic alone converts raw negative errors to `-1` and `errno`. `LinuxOutputNativeTests` runs ten original cases on host Linux with regular-file redirects; modeled x64/ARM64 cases also check budgets. Explicit GKI selection retains its released version's metadata and transfer-cap order; see [released GKI contracts](android-gki-kernels.md). See the [Linux vector import contract](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/lib/iov_iter.c).

The existing ELF loader supplies decoded program headers. OS policy validates
ABI tags, segment alignment, mapped program-header tables and user-address
bounds before execution. A generic mapping plan checks extents, permissions,
overlap and budget before allocation; the model publishes only a fully prepared
private address space. Linux mappings preserve file-page prefix/tail bytes,
zero BSS, honor segment permissions and reserve stack guard gaps. Page-overlap
layouts and contradictory headers are rejected rather than guessed.

Static PIE uses a deterministic load bias of at least `0x40000000`, increased
to honor larger `PT_LOAD` alignment. Every mapped segment, entry PC and
`AT_PHDR`/`AT_ENTRY` uses that same bias; the file's program-header values stay
unmodified. `AT_BASE` remains zero because no interpreter is loaded. This is a
reproducible placement policy, not Linux ASLR. Startup follows the direct-entry
path of the [Linux ELF loader](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/fs/binfmt_elf.c).

The mapping source is explicitly the original file, so analysis-time pointer
fixups cannot leak into guest execution. Guest startup must perform its own
relocations and initialization. The loader decodes `PT_DYNAMIC` from bounded
original file records, independently of optional sections; the process model
requires a readable, terminated table of at most 4096 entries when present. `PT_INTERP`
and external dependency/filter/audit tags are rejected. The model does not
silently provide a dynamic linker, symbol resolver or constructor runner.

The initial stack contains aligned argc/argv/envp/auxv, mapped PHDR/PHENT/PHNUM,
entry/page-size values and identity entries. Model PID/TID/UID/GID are 1000.
`AT_RANDOM` contains the first 16 bytes of the input's SHA-256 for reproducible
execution; this is explicitly a deterministic model policy, not cryptographic
entropy. HWCAP/HWCAP2 are zero; there is no vDSO. Startup conventions follow the
[Linux ELF loader](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/binfmt_elf.c).

Implemented calls are `write`, `writev`, `exit`, `exit_group`, `getpid`, `gettid`,
`getuid`, `geteuid`, `getgid`, `getegid`,
`mmap`, `mprotect`, `munmap`, `madvise`, `brk`, `gettimeofday`, `clock_gettime` and
bounded `rt_sigaction`, with
separate [x64](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl)
and [asm-generic ARM64](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h)
numbers. Returning x64 SYSCALL applies its RCX/R11 clobbers as well as RAX and
the next PC. ARM64 uses x8 for the number and x0 for the result. Unknown calls
stop as `unsupported_service`; they never execute host syscalls.
Real/effective identity queries agree with the corresponding auxv entries.
They use the deterministic model identity above; credential-changing services
such as `setuid` remain unsupported.

The optional `linux_kernel` input records explicitly observed absent kernel
interfaces. For example, a fixture with no `pidfd_open` implementation uses:

```json
{"linux_kernel":{"unavailable_syscalls":["pidfd_open"]}}
```

The selected raw call returns -ENOSYS before argument validation, as a missing
kernel entry does, and creates no descriptor or guest-memory effect. Bionic's
`syscall` wrapper retains its normal -1/errno translation. Missing input and an
empty list retain the existing unsupported boundary for this interface;
other unknown calls are not converted to ENOSYS. Currently only `pidfd_open`
is admitted; unknown names, duplicates and wrong types are rejected. This
input does not infer a kernel version, host availability or a working pidfd
implementation. See the [kernel missing-call implementation](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/sys_ni.c).

An explicit `linux_kernel.gki` selects a released Android common kernel branch
from 5.10 through 6.18. Its current implemented subset includes `pidfd_open`
for the live model process and explicitly catalogued guest tasks, versioned
vector import, observed process CPU clocks and zero-timeout pidfd `ppoll`, with
the same descriptor
table used by `linux_files`; Bionic and raw traps share ownership and error ordering.
Selecting GKI together with an absent `pidfd_open` observation is rejected.
An optional `linux_kernel.tasks` array supplies a closed, fixed catalogue of
additional live tasks as `{ "id": 2000, "group_leader": true }` entries.
An omitted array leaves foreign target lookup unsupported; an empty array knows
only the running group leader. A PID outside a declared catalogue returns ESRCH.
Entries and priority observations must be consistent, and the fixed catalogue
cannot be combined with cooperative Android guest threads.
Android API levels do not select a kernel. See the
[released GKI contracts](android-gki-kernels.md) for all eight source pins,
descriptor behavior, tests and the remaining kernel coverage.
The poll subset requires an explicit zero timespec, null temporary mask and
`linux_files` descriptor limit. It writes only ordered `revents` fields and
does not update the zero timeout or advance wall clocks. Closed descriptors
produce POLLNVAL; observed live pidfds have no readiness. Blocking waits and
other descriptor readiness remain unsupported.

The optional `linux_priority` input declares nice state for fixture-owned tasks
with the caller's UID. Raw `setpriority` and `getpriority` share this state across
Linux ELF64 and Android native workloads; they never change host priorities.

```json
{"linux_priority":{"tasks":[{"id":1000,"nice":0}],
                   "cap_sys_nice":false,"rlimit_nice":0}}
```

Task IDs are distinct positive signed 32-bit values, initial nice values are
-20 through 19, and `rlimit_nice` is 0 through 40. `cap_sys_nice` and
`rlimit_nice` default to false and zero; task state is always explicit. Missing
input, unlisted tasks, and PRIO_PGRP/PRIO_USER selection stop with an unsupported
service. This includes newly created threads whose nice state was not declared;
the model does not guess inheritance or another task's ownership. PRIO_PROCESS
with who zero selects the current guest task, otherwise the named task.
Invalid selectors return raw -EINVAL. Set requests clamp their signed 32-bit
nice argument to -20..19. Lowering nice requires CAP_SYS_NICE or a sufficient
RLIMIT_NICE limit; denial returns raw -EACCES without changing state.
Raw get requests return `20 - nice`, preserving the kernel's 40..1 encoding;
this is not libc's translated `getpriority` result. See the
[Linux priority interface](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html).

`linux_signals` supplies process-wide initial kernel actions. A missing entry
is unknown; it does not imply `SIG_DFL`. An explicit empty action list enables
installing actions without observing an unknown predecessor. For example:

```json
{"linux_signals":{"actions":[
  {"signal":11,"handler":0,"flags":0,"restorer":0,"mask":0}
]}}
```

Signal numbers are 1–64; each entry requires all five fields. The four action
words are unsigned 64-bit values, with decimal strings for values beyond the
exact JSON integer range. Duplicate entries, unknown fields, blocked
SIGKILL/SIGSTOP bits, and nonzero actions for those two signals are rejected.
Inputs describe the kernel layout: handler, flags, restorer and eight-byte mask.
They are not read from the host or inferred from a selected native function.

`rt_sigaction` requires `sigsetsize == 8`, copies the new 32-byte LP64 record
before validating the signal, then observes/replaces the shared disposition.
It removes SIGKILL/SIGSTOP from new masks. Common Linux action flags are retained,
including Bionic's sign-extended 32-bit flags; unknown flag extensions stop.
An invalid old-output pointer returns EFAULT after a successful installation.
Mixed-access kernel copies stop before unmodeled partial bytes are written.
These ordered effects follow the [Linux signal implementation](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/16a2d602244f/kernel/signal.c).
There are no queued signals, asynchronous delivery, handler invocation, signal
frames, `sigreturn`, alternate stacks or per-thread signal-mask operations in
this contract. CPU faults retain their existing explicit stop behavior.

`mincore` supports ordered validation, zero-length queries and a first queried
page that is unmapped. Alignment errors return EINVAL before address-range
checks; an invalid query range returns ENOMEM before vector-range validation.
The vector consumes one byte per rounded-up page. Numerical vector-range
errors return EFAULT, but an unmapped vector does not precede ENOMEM for an
unmapped first query page. These paths do not write the vector. A mapped first
page, including PROT_NONE, stops explicitly because mapping ownership alone
does not establish Linux residency. The model does not skip a mapped prefix to
report a later hole, fabricate resident bits or query the host. This bounded
ordering follows the [Linux implementation](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/16a2d602244f/mm/mincore.c).

Static ELF TLS templates (`PT_TLS`) are validated as loader-owned facts, with
one template, bounded file/memory extents, alignment congruence and readable
initialized bytes. Guest startup allocates and initializes each TLS block and
installs its thread pointer; the Linux model does not invent a libc-specific
TCB or DTV. This permits compiler-generated local-exec TLS in freestanding
programs. Dynamic TLS, a dynamic linker and OS thread creation remain separate
work.

On x64, `arch_prctl` supports `ARCH_SET_FS`, `ARCH_GET_FS`, `ARCH_SET_GS` and
`ARCH_GET_GS`. Set accepts an unmapped user-range base; a later dereference still
checks user permissions. Kernel-range bases return guest `EPERM`; invalid get
destinations return guest `EFAULT` without faulting the CPU. Other operations
stop as unsupported, never as a success stub. The behavior follows the
[Linux arch_prctl implementation](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c).
ARM64 startup installs `TPIDR_EL0` with the architecturally unprivileged `MSR`
instruction. The corresponding `MRS`, x64 FS/GS memory accesses, and CPU context
restoration preserve each thread pointer across execution quanta and backend
entries. This does not itself implement a thread scheduler.

Descriptors 1 and 2 are virtual byte sinks. `write` validates readable user
pages, returns a readable prefix when a later page is inaccessible, and returns
guest `EFAULT` when no bytes are readable. A bad descriptor returns `EBADF`;
a zero-count write still validates the user address range, but does not
require a mapped page or read any payload.
These sinks do not model Linux pipe atomicity or file objects. Native fixture
comparison agrees on ordinary output and on partial writes to regular files;
Linux pipes can reject that same small cross-page write completely. Output
limits stop before publishing an over-budget write.

Anonymous memory services use the same process address space and physical
memory budget as the loaded image and stack. `mmap` accepts exactly
`MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS`, with ordinary `PROT_NONE`, `PROT_READ`,
`PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE`, `PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC` and readable RWX permissions.
Free, page-aligned hints are honored; otherwise placement searches gaps from
`0x100000000`, then from the minimum user address, reserving the stack guards.
This deterministic policy does not emulate Linux ASLR. New anonymous pages
are zero-filled and independently owned, so partial unmapping can reclaim
unpinned page allocations. A CPU projection or retained backing view may keep
a retired allocation alive until its own lifetime ends.

Lengths round to pages. `munmap` tolerates holes and repeated removal;
`mprotect` changes the mapped prefix before returning `ENOMEM` at a hole.
`PROT_NONE` preserves the allocation and bytes while denying guest access.
The raw `brk` call returns the requested byte boundary on success and the old
boundary on failure; it is not the libc wrapper's zero/minus-one convention.
The initial break is the page-aligned image end. Growth respects other mappings
and the memory budget; shrinking preserves bytes in its remaining partial page.
Rules and error precedence for the supported subset follow the Linux
[mapping](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/mm/mmap.c) and
[protection](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/mm/mprotect.c) services.

`madvise` admits `MADV_MERGEABLE` and `MADV_UNMERGEABLE`. It records KSM
eligibility over guest RAM, including read-only and `PROT_NONE` pages. The
deterministic profile keeps the background scanner stopped: advice does not
deduplicate backing allocations or change bytes or access permissions. Partial
revocation splits the eligible range; `munmap` and heap shrink retire the
removed policy, and new allocations start ineligible. Alignment and rounding
overflow return `EINVAL`; an aligned empty range succeeds. Holes return
`ENOMEM` while still applying advice to mapped portions on either side. The
behavior argument uses its low 32 bits, matching the Linux `int` ABI. These
rules follow Linux's [advice dispatch](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/mm/madvise.c)
and [KSM policy](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/mm/ksm.c). Other
advice, including `MADV_DONTNEED` and `MADV_FREE`, stops as an unsupported
service before changing state; discarding content is not modeled as a hint.

File/shared/fixed mappings, grow-down, huge pages, memory locking, protection
keys, execute-only/write-only policy and other flags remain explicit unsupported
service contracts. They stop before publishing effects or inventing a syscall
return. Ordinary range/length/alignment errors within the admitted subset return
guest errors and allow execution to continue. No memory service forwards a
guest pointer or mapping request to the host OS.

<!-- i18n-section: linux-clocks -->

## Explicit guest clocks

The optional `linux_time` input supplies observations, fixed by default, shared by raw
Linux services and Android Bionic. It never reads the host clock, advances time
with instruction execution, or supplies a default epoch. For example:

```json
{"linux_time":{"clocks":[
  {"id":0,"seconds":"4294967297","nanoseconds":987654321},
  {"id":1,"seconds":123,"nanoseconds":456789}],
  "timezone":{"minutes_west":-60,"dst_time":0}}}
```

Clock IDs include Linux's static IDs 0–9 and 11: realtime, monotonic, process CPU,
thread CPU, monotonic raw, realtime coarse, monotonic coarse, boottime,
realtime alarm, boottime alarm and TAI. Each is independent; absent clocks are
unknown, including coarse variants. Selected released GKI contracts also admit
negative encoded process CPU clock IDs with explicit live group observations;
see [released GKI clocks](android-gki-kernels.md#implemented-process-cpu-clock-subset).
PROF, VIRT and SCHED retain independent observations; aliases of the current
process share one observation. Duplicate identities,
unknown input IDs and more than 16384 clock observations are errors.
Seconds are signed 64-bit and must be nonnegative for CPU clocks;
nanoseconds must be in `[0, 1000000000)`. Integer
JSON numbers are accepted within `±9007199254740991`; decimal strings preserve
the full signed range. Timezone fields are signed 32-bit integers. C++ callers
use `ProcessOptions::LinuxTime`, with the same value validation. Other process
profiles reject this option.

`"advance_on_idle": true` explicitly enables relative `nanosleep` on x64 and
ARM64, including Android's named and variadic wrappers. Clock IDs 0, 1 and
7 advance from their initial values by elapsed virtual time. Process CPU clock
observations may coexist with this policy and stay fixed during idle advancement.
Other clock inputs remain excluded from this policy.
A sleeping Android thread retains its original pending service;
other runnable threads execute first. When all threads are blocked, time advances
to the earliest sleep deadline. A single-threaded workload advances directly.
Instruction execution itself does not advance time, so a busy runnable thread
can leave a sleeper pending until the workload budget expires.

The request is copied before checking nonnegative seconds and normalized
nanoseconds. Bad input addresses return `EFAULT`; invalid values return `EINVAL`.
Normal completion leaves the remaining-time pointer and Bionic errno untouched.
Zero duration returns without advancing. Saturated or overflowing deadlines and
clock overflow stop explicitly; no partial clock advancement is committed.
This deterministic policy excludes signal interruption/restart, absolute sleeps,
timer slack, CPU-time accounting and host scheduling. Disabled policy retains
an explicit unsupported-service stop for sleep.
The copy/validation/completion boundary follows Linux's
[relative nanosleep implementation](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/kernel/time/hrtimer.c);
Android's error conversion follows the API 28
[AArch64 Bionic wrapper](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_bionic/blob/android-9.0.0_r1/libc/arch-arm64/syscalls/nanosleep.S).

`clock_gettime` consumes the low signed 32 bits of its clock ID, returns
`EINVAL` for invalid positive IDs before accessing the destination. Selected GKI
process CPU clocks validate their target before the destination; other encoded
and dynamic clocks stop explicitly. A known clock without input stops as
`unsupported_service`. `gettimeofday` writes seconds and truncated microseconds
as two ordered 64-bit fields, followed by the optional pair of 32-bit timezone
fields. `gettimeofday(NULL, NULL)` needs no input. Missing timezone input stops
after any completed timeval writes. The x64 `time` syscall returns realtime
seconds and optionally stores one 64-bit value; ARM64 has no such syscall.
These follow the Linux [time service](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/kernel/time/time.c)
and [clock dispatch](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/kernel/time/posix-timers.c)
contracts for the modeled subset.

Fully writable outputs, including unaligned ones, are supported. A wholly
inaccessible output returns `EFAULT`; earlier completed gettimeofday fields
remain written. Mixed accessibility within a single 8-byte store or 16-byte
timespec copy stops before that operation because architecture-specific partial
fault writes are not modeled. Adjustment, resolution queries, scheduling,
sleep and real device clocks remain unsupported.

<!-- i18n-section: linux-files -->

## Explicit memory files

`linux_files` supplies immutable file bytes to Linux ELF64 and Android native
workloads. C++ uses `ProcessOptions::LinuxFiles`; C, Python and CLI share this
strict JSON contract:

```json
{"linux_files":{"files":[
  {"path":"/fixture/data","bytes_hex":"00ff410a805a"}],
  "descriptor_limit":256}}
```

`files` is required and may be empty. Every entry requires `path` and
`bytes_hex`, with optional `metadata`; empty bytes describe an empty file. Paths must be distinct,
absolute and canonical, with no NUL, empty, `.` or `..` components or trailing
slash. Paths have fewer than 4096 bytes and components at most 255 bytes.
A file cannot be another file's parent directory. The catalogue holds at most
256 files and 16 MiB total content and NUL-terminated path bytes. The existing
64 KiB JSON request ceiling also applies. `descriptor_limit` defaults to 256,
accepts 3–4096, and is the exclusive descriptor ceiling, including 0, 1 and 2.
Other process profiles reject these options before loading an image.

The catalogue is closed: absent paths return `ENOENT`. No host file, process
command line, environment or implicit `/proc` content is consulted. Without
`linux_files`, file services remain unsupported. Supplied bytes are explicit
workload facts; naming a proc path does not model procfs or its dynamic content.

Raw x64 `open`, x64/ARM64 `openat`, `read`, `close` and `lseek` share one
process-owned descriptor table. Android `open`, `open64`, `openat`, `openat64`,
`read`, `close`, `lseek`, `lseek64`, `fstat`, `fstat64` and `syscall` use that same state, including
across guest threads. Bionic alone maps kernel errors to `-1` and thread-local
`errno`; success preserves errno. Absolute paths ignore `dirfd`; mode is unused
without creation. Ordinary file opens admit `O_RDONLY`, optional `O_CLOEXEC`
and the architecture's `O_LARGEFILE`. `O_DIRECTORY` also admits known pathname
failures and requires the final object to be a directory. `O_DIRECT` admits
pathname and descriptor-exhaustion failures before reaching an opened file;
the catalogue does not infer its backing filesystem's direct-I/O support.
ARM64's directory/direct bits are `0x4000`/`0x10000`, while x64 uses
`0x10000`/`0x4000`. These stable source-pinned rules do not require GKI selection.
Other flags, relative paths, internal repeated
separators, `.`/`..` components,
directory opens, writes/creation, symlinks, duplication and descriptor-control
operations remain unsupported. Exec is unmodeled, so close-on-exec flags have
no observable transition in this subset.

Guest queries accept canonical absolute names followed by one or more `/`
characters. Trailing separators require the final object to be a directory:
queries of a regular file with a trailing slash return `ENOTDIR`, and missing
names still return `ENOENT`. Paths consisting only of slashes name the root.
Directory opens and directory metadata remain unsupported. This parsing does
not relax the canonical keys required by the catalogue configuration. The
directory requirement follows Linux
[pathname lookup](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/path-lookup.html).

Existence queries use the same pathname import and closed catalogue. Raw x64
`access` (21), x64/ARM64 `faccessat` (269/48), and Android `access`/`faccessat`
support `F_OK`: files, their ancestor directories and `/` exist; missing paths
return `ENOENT`, and a file used as an ancestor returns `ENOTDIR`. The explicit
catalogue admits traversal of its directory prefixes; it supplies no general
directory permission model. Queries allocate no descriptor and preserve all
cursors, including when the descriptor table is full. Invalid low 32-bit mode
bits return `EINVAL` before pathname access. `R_OK`, `W_OK` and `X_OK` on an
existing entry remain unsupported: observed metadata does not establish
credentials, ACLs or mount policy. Raw `faccessat` consumes three arguments;
the [API 28 Bionic wrapper](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_bionic/blob/android-9.0.0_r1/libc/bionic/faccessat.cpp)
rejects nonzero flags with `EINVAL` before entering the kernel. The kernel
validation order follows [Linux access](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/fs/open.c).

Each open starts an independent cursor and chooses the lowest unused
nonnegative descriptor. Exhaustion returns `EMFILE` after pathname import;
close releases the descriptor. Slots 0–2 initially reserve unknown stdin and
the existing captured stdout/stderr streams. Closing those slots enables
ordinary file reuse; writes through a closed slot or read-only file return
`EBADF`. Reading stdin remains unsupported; it is never assumed to be empty.
Descriptors, open flags and seek modes consume their low 32 bits.

Directory creation supports only failures already determined by pathname
lookup. Raw x64 `mkdir` (83), x64/ARM64 `mkdirat` (258/34), and Android
`mkdir`/`mkdirat` share the catalogue: a missing parent returns `ENOENT`, a file
ancestor returns `ENOTDIR`, and an existing file or directory returns `EEXIST`.
The final name's `EEXIST` result also applies to a regular file followed by
trailing slashes; directory creation checks the parent separately.
They preserve the catalogue, descriptors and cursors. An absent final name
under an existing directory remains unsupported; mode, umask, write permission
and successful creation have no invented defaults. The boundary follows
[Linux parent and final-component lookup](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/fs/namei.c)
and the [API 28 Bionic wrapper](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_bionic/blob/android-9.0.0_r1/libc/bionic/mkdir.cpp).

Reads validate the original user range before the page-aligned Linux transfer
cap or EOF, copy only available bytes, and advance by exactly the copied
prefix. A later inaccessible page preserves that prefix; a fault before any
byte returns `EFAULT`. Empty reads and EOF do not probe payload mappings.
A zero-length user range may start exactly at the user limit. After validating
that range, a file position plus the original count above `INT64_MAX` returns
`EINVAL`, including at EOF; neither failure advances the cursor.
Ordinary `SEEK_SET`, `SEEK_CUR` and `SEEK_END` keep a signed 64-bit nonnegative
cursor, permit seeking beyond EOF, and reject negative/overflowing positions
without changing it. `SEEK_DATA` and `SEEK_HOLE` remain unsupported. These are
bounded memory-file semantics based on Linux's [open lifecycle](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.6/fs/open.c),
[read/seek contracts](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.6/fs/read_write.c)
and [AArch64 flags](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.6/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/fcntl.h),
not general filesystem compatibility.

File status requires explicit observations. The optional `metadata` object has
exactly these fields; all are required when the object is present:

| Fields | Admitted values |
| --- | --- |
| `device` | Linux encoded unsigned 32-bit device number |
| `inode` | Unsigned 64-bit integer |
| `mode` | `S_IFREG` (32768) plus permission/special bits (0–4095) |
| `link_count`, `uid`, `gid` | Unsigned 32-bit integers |
| `size`, `blocks` | 0–`INT64_MAX`; blocks are 512-byte units |
| `block_size` | 0–`INT32_MAX` |
| `access_time`, `modification_time`, `change_time` | Objects with signed 64-bit `seconds` and `nanoseconds` from 0 to 999999999 |

All observation integers accept decimal strings for their full width. Numeric
JSON values must be integral and within ±(2^53−1), as for `linux_time`. Unknown
fields, missing members and invalid ranges fail before execution. C++ stores
these observations in `LinuxFileOptions::Metadata`, keyed by a path already in
`Files`; a key without file bytes is rejected. For example, this is an explicit
virtual-file observation with nonempty bytes and a reported size of zero:

```json
{"linux_files":{"files":[{"path":"/fixture/virtual","bytes_hex":"616263",
  "metadata":{"device":1,"inode":"18446744073709551615","mode":33060,
    "link_count":1,"uid":1000,"gid":1000,"size":0,"block_size":4096,"blocks":0,
    "access_time":{"seconds":0,"nanoseconds":0},
    "modification_time":{"seconds":0,"nanoseconds":0},
    "change_time":{"seconds":0,"nanoseconds":0}}}]}}
```

These immutable observations do not change access policy or byte-vector read
and seek behavior, and are never inferred from host metadata. Raw `fstat`
(x64 5, AArch64 80), Bionic `fstat`/`fstat64` and variadic `syscall` use the same
descriptor state without advancing its cursor. The ABI structures are 144 bytes
on x64 and 128 bytes on AArch64, with zero `rdev` and padding for regular files.
An invalid descriptor returns `EBADF` before accessing the output. A file
without metadata or a standard stream with unknown identity stops explicitly.
With known metadata, a wholly inaccessible or out-of-range output returns
`EFAULT`. Mixed writable/inaccessible output stops without changing bytes;
architecture-specific partial `copy_to_user` effects are not modeled. This is
the same fixed-copy policy used by Linux clock services. See the Linux
[status conversion](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.6/fs/stat.c),
[AArch64 layout](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.6/include/uapi/asm-generic/stat.h)
and [x64 layout](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.6/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/stat.h).

`newfstatat` (x64 262, AArch64 79), Bionic `fstatat`/`fstatat64` and variadic
`syscall` query those same observations. Absolute paths in the supported form ignore dirfd;
missing entries return `ENOENT`, and traversal through a regular file returns
`ENOTDIR`. `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` and `AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT` are accepted for this
catalogue, which has neither symlinks nor automounts. A non-NULL empty pathname
with `AT_EMPTY_PATH` queries an existing descriptor without changing its cursor;
without that flag it returns `ENOENT`. Closed descriptors return `EBADF`.
The directory and flags arguments use their low 32 bits. Invalid flag bits
return `EINVAL` before path errors; the complete pathname is imported before
status output, so input and output may overlap.

Relative paths, directory metadata, the current working directory, NULL with
`AT_EMPTY_PATH`, and stat synchronization flags remain unsupported. The last two
have changed across kernel releases; the model does not infer a kernel version.
Path queries use the same fixed-copy policy and explicit metadata requirement
as descriptor queries. Contracts were checked against Linux
[v4.9](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/fs/stat.c) and
[v6.12](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.12/fs/stat.c), and the LP64
[Bionic service aliases](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_bionic/blob/android-9.0.0_r1/libc/SYSCALLS.TXT).

`statfs` (x64 137, AArch64 43) and `fstatfs` (x64 138, AArch64 44)
resolve names and descriptors in that same explicit catalogue. Path imports
preserve `EFAULT` and `ENAMETOOLONG`; missing names return `ENOENT`, and a regular
file used as a directory returns `ENOTDIR`. Closed or unknown descriptors return
`EBADF`, using the low 32 bits of the descriptor argument. These errors precede
output access and leave every output byte unchanged. Queries of existing files,
implicit directories, root or live standard streams remain unsupported because
file metadata does not provide filesystem observations. No successful filesystem
status or mount information is inferred. Bionic `statfs`/`statfs64`,
`fstatfs`/`fstatfs64` and variadic `syscall` share these error paths and the usual
errno conversion. See Linux's [filesystem query order](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/fs/statfs.c)
and the [API 28 LP64 wrappers](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_bionic/blob/android-9.0.0_r61/libc/bionic/statvfs.cpp).

## Windows PE64 profile

`windows-pe64-v1` supports bounded Windows x64/ARM64 console processes with PEB/TEB, static and dynamic TLS, `DllMain`, named Win32 APIs and explicit acyclic DLL graphs. Guest modules support named/ordinal code and data imports, DIR64 rebasing, forwarded exports and actual loader-list identities. `LoadLibraryA` / `LoadLibraryW`, `FreeLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` use the configured module catalogue. CRT/GUI, ARM64 frame-based user SEH, threads and general Windows application compatibility remain unfinished; native ARM64 KVM/WHP evidence is still pending.

Windows virtual memory adds `VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualFree`, `VirtualProtect`, `VirtualQuery` and current-process `FlushInstructionCache`. The OS layer owns reservations; `AddressSpace` remains the authority for committed pages, permissions and backing. Tests cover dynamic code rewriting, access faults and memory-budget reuse.

Private allocations support `MEM_RESERVE`, `MEM_COMMIT`, `MEM_DECOMMIT`, `MEM_RELEASE` and `MEM_TOP_DOWN`, with 64 KiB reservation alignment and 4 KiB pages. Reserve-only regions consume no guest RAM. Recommit preserves bytes and updates protection; decommit returns individual page backing. Whole-range validation and staged allocation prevent partial changes on ordinary allocation/protection failures. Query returns the 48-byte x64/ARM64 memory-information layout and coalesces forward within one allocation. The initial image, environment, heap arena, API gates and stack margins participate in placement. Stack allocation identity agrees with TEB. If a successful `VirtualProtect` makes its old-protection output read-only, the new protection remains installed, the output bytes stay unchanged, and the call still succeeds. An uncommitted-range protection failure returns `ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS`, writes `PAGE_NOACCESS` to the old-protection output and leaves page permissions unchanged.

Supported protections are `PAGE_NOACCESS`, `PAGE_READONLY`, `PAGE_READWRITE`, `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ` and `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`. Guard pages, execute-only and copy-on-write policies, cache modifiers, large pages, reset/write-watch/placeholders and modification of model-owned runtime mappings remain explicit unsupported operations. Only private virtual allocations can be decommitted or released.

[VirtualAlloc](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc), [VirtualFree](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree), [VirtualProtect](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect), [VirtualQuery](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualquery), [MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-memory_basic_information).

```bash
neverd emulate guest.exe --profile=windows-pe64-v1 \
  --options='{"backend":"auto","arguments":["guest.exe","argument"],"environment":["MODE=test"]}'
```

The single-thread profile keeps the PE32+ EXE at its preferred base and admits explicitly supplied DLLs with optional entry points and static TLS. `WindowsProcessOptions::Modules`, or JSON `windows.modules`, supplies up to 64 guest basenames and host input paths through `name` and `path`; there is no host DLL search or execution. ASCII names compare without case; duplicate names and overrides of modeled system providers fail. Only reachable files are read. Named/ordinal function and data imports bind to actual mapped exports; holes, missing symbols, cycles, bound/delay imports and unsupported load configuration/CFG fail explicitly. DIR64 records rebase colliding movable DLLs; fixed collisions and relocation writes into linker metadata fail before publishing the affected image.

`readPEProgramExports` owns original export identities and bounded metadata footprints. `WindowsProcessModules` owns the guest graph and one exact provider/name API gate per process. `VirtualMemory` reserves every image before mapping; `AddressSpace` owns pages and permissions. PEB/LDR lists contain real images, with loader registration order in the initialization list. Registration and dependency-based attach order are tracked separately. `GetModuleHandleW` accepts NULL or ASCII basenames, compares without case, and appends `.dll` when no extension is supplied; paths, non-ASCII lookup and trailing-dot rules remain unsupported. Missing names return error 126; success preserves LastError. API models are not installed system DLLs.

Input-file bytes and aggregate image extents each share `memory_limit`; runtime mappings also consume the image budget. Preparation shares a 65,536-record and 64 MiB metadata-read allowance, bounded names and the workload deadline. Blocking host I/O has no hard time guarantee. The original EXE→DLL→DLL fixture checks rebased pointers, ordinal calls, shared data, API pointer identity, `MEM_IMAGE`, loader lists and executable TLS attach/detach. `NeverDWindowsProcessTests` owns these checks and the direct native Windows oracle; `NeverDPEProgramExportsTests` checks malformed metadata and work accounting, and `NeverDProcessPublicTests` checks C ABI/CLI catalogue parity. Unavailable transports are explicit skips.

`WindowsProcessLifetime` runs dependency DLL TLS callbacks then `DllMain`, followed by EXE TLS and entry, on one CPU under the same execution budget. Each module gets an independent TLS index and aligned block copied from the relocated, linked image within a shared 64 KiB arena. TLS reserved arguments are zero; startup/process-detach `DllMain` receives an opaque non-null value. Explicit process exit detaches successfully initialized DLLs in reverse loader-list order, then EXE TLS, even if EXE initialization had not run. Startup `DllMain(FALSE)` exits with `0xc0000142` without detach notifications. Faults and exhausted budgets do not invent cleanup. Returning from the PE entry with guest DLLs requires unsupported thread termination and stops explicitly. Nonzero `SizeOfZeroFill` remains unsupported; zero-initialized bytes in the actual TLS template are supported. DLLs without entry points receive TLS attach but no process-detach notifications.

`WindowsProcessExports` resolves static imports and `GetProcAddress` through the same named/ordinal identities, including code, data, aliases and chained forwarders. Only demanded startup forwarders add catalogue modules and initialization dependencies; unused forwarders do not load files. Export names are case sensitive; a missing name returns NULL/error 127, a direct missing ordinal (including a hole) returns NULL/error 182, and a null query argument returns error 87, while success preserves LastError. Unknown module handles remain unsupported. Exact provider/name API gates are reserved once from the bounded registry. Resolution checks every queried image’s live PE headers and export metadata, rejects changes or unreadable bytes, limits chains to 64 entries, and shares remaining preparation metadata credits and the workload deadline. A forwarder targeting a hole returns the target image base and preserves LastError; forwarding to ordinal zero returns error 87. The returned base is a data address, not permission to execute image headers. Runtime forwarders can load configured catalogue modules and complete initialization before returning a lookup result. Live export-table rewriting remains unsupported.

`WindowsProcessLoader` loads ASCII DLL basenames from `windows.modules` and owns explicit references, shared dependencies and startup retention. Repeated forwarded queries do not acquire extra references. Catalogue slots carry a new resident generation on reload. TLS and `DllMain` execute on the same CPU below suspended API frames; restoring registers preserves guest writes and uses the live return slot. Dynamic attach/detach reserved pointers are zero. Failed attach during explicit loading returns error 1114 after cleanup, retaining successful independent nested loads. Unload releases image mappings and TLS; reload restores original image contents. Loader-list or TLS-pointer changes outside the model fail explicitly. File, image and metadata work credits remain cumulative across failures and reloads. System providers use their mapped PE bases as module handles. Filesystem search, non-ASCII paths, `LoadLibraryEx` flags, cyclic imports and reentrant transitions of an already initializing or unloading module remain unsupported.

`GetEnvironmentVariableW`, `SetEnvironmentVariableW`, `GetEnvironmentStringsW`, `FreeEnvironmentStringsW`, `ExpandEnvironmentStringsW` share the live guest environment block in PEB process parameters. Names are ASCII and case insensitive; values are UTF-16. Updates validate inputs, capacity and writable memory before publication. Snapshots remain independent after changes and release their guest backing on free. The block has a 64 KiB model limit; strings and expansions are bounded and check the workload deadline. Unknown pointer ownership, malformed blocks, ANSI code pages and overlapping expansion buffers remain unsupported. `WindowsEnvironmentTests.cpp` compares original x64/ARM64 fixtures across available backends and requires an independent native Windows oracle in CI.

`WindowsProcessHeap` now owns allocation, [`HeapReAlloc`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heaprealloc), free and size queries in one process heap. Resizing preserves the retained bytes; `HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY` clears newly exposed bytes, and `HEAP_REALLOC_IN_PLACE_ONLY` forbids movement. Failed resizing preserves the old block and returns NULL with `ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY` (8), matching the native observations. Separate page backing lets shrink/free return capacity, while staged growth and bounded copies observe the workload deadline. Custom heaps, exception-generating flags, unknown ownership and inaccessible copy/zero spans stop explicitly. `WindowsHeapTests.cpp` covers both ISAs, forced movement, budget reuse and failure atomicity; CI also runs the original EXE against native Windows.

`WindowsSystemModules` builds bounded PE64 model images for `ntdll.dll`, `kernelbase.dll` and `kernel32.dll` on both ISAs. Their mapped bases are shared by ASCII `GetModuleHandleA` / [`GetModuleHandleW`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulehandlew), `LoadLibraryA` / `LoadLibraryW` and [`GetProcAddress`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress); PEB/LDR and `MEM_IMAGE` describe those same images. Static imports, named queries and guest forwarders use the same API gates and export resolver. Providers stay pinned, have no guest initialization callbacks and do not prevent entry return after ordinary guest DLLs unload. Changed headers or export metadata stop lookup. Unknown system export names and nonzero system ordinal queries stop explicitly; case-only mismatches of modeled names and empty names return error 127, while a null query returns 87. Generated bytes and addresses are model policy; Windows DLL version layouts, native ordinals and cross-provider aliases are not reconstructed. `WindowsSystemTests.cpp` compares original x64/ARM64 executables with native Windows, including eight independent initial-thread returns.

`WindowsProcessExceptions` implements `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`, `RemoveVectoredExceptionHandler` and `RaiseException` on one CPU with the process budget. Ordered handlers may register or remove handlers, raise nested exceptions, call modeled APIs, load DLLs and exit the process. x64/ARM64 data-access violations and x64 integer divide faults can resume after validated guest edits to `CONTEXT`; general registers, SIMD and supported FP state are preserved. Software exceptions resume through a real return instruction in the modeled provider. The model bounds registrations to 128 retained entries and nesting to 16 frames. Invalid dispositions, changed exception pointers, unsupported context fields and exhausted bounds fail explicitly. ARM64 frame-based SEH/unwinding, debugger delivery and execute/guard faults remain unsupported. `WindowsExceptionTests.cpp` compares original EXE/DLL scenarios against native Windows; native ARM64 KVM/WHP evidence remains pending. [AddVectoredExceptionHandler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-addvectoredexceptionhandler), [RemoveVectoredExceptionHandler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-removevectoredexceptionhandler), [RaiseException](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-raiseexception), [CONTEXT x64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-context), [ARM64_NT_CONTEXT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-arm64_nt_context). Software exception records carry `EXCEPTION_SOFTWARE_ORIGINATE` (`0x80`), independently of the caller’s noncontinuable flag; the original Windows executable checks the exact software and hardware flag values. [EXCEPTION_RECORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-exception_record).

`WindowsProcessContext` retains each dispatch frame’s origin. Admitted x64 data-access and divide faults expose RF (`0x10000`) in `CONTEXT.EFlags`; `RaiseException`, including software access-violation codes, retains the current context. The origin survives VEH/VCH and SEH search/unwind. Valid continuation restores logical CPU flags without RF; guest edits to RF are rejected before state publication. This bounded profile does not model instruction breakpoints or guest-controlled RF. `WindowsExceptionTests.cpp` checks saved records, restoration and unchanged CPU/RAM on rejection.

Windows ring3 maps checked x64 `operand_alignment` faults to `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` with parameters `[read, UINT64_MAX]`, including stores, following independent native observations. The CPU layer supplies the cause; Windows does not guess it from vector 13 or decode the instruction again. `WindowsAlignmentProcessTests.cpp` runs original PE instructions across 72 fault scenarios and 9 address-repair retries (`72 + 9`), checking PC, RF, XMM state and RAM. Unclassified or inconsistent faults remain rejected. Process and driver fault reports preserve nullable `cause` and hexadecimal `error_code`; absence stays distinct from zero. This delivery applies to the checked x64 user profile.

`AddVectoredContinueHandler` and `RemoveVectoredContinueHandler` maintain a separate ordered list, sharing the 128 retained registration limit with exception handlers. Continue callbacks run after a vectored exception handler accepts continuation; they see the same mutable exception record and `CONTEXT`. Final context validation happens after these callbacks, including nested exceptions and DLL notifications. Handles cannot be removed through the other handler family. `WindowsContinuationTests.cpp` compares original executables for ordering, short-circuiting, mutation, context repair, nested dispatch, loader callbacks and process exit against native Windows. The tested Windows x64 vectored path permits continuation with `EXCEPTION_NONCONTINUABLE` set; this does not establish frame-based SEH behavior. Native ARM64 execution remains unverified. [AddVectoredContinueHandler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-addvectoredcontinuehandler), [RemoveVectoredContinueHandler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-removevectoredcontinuehandler).

`RtlCaptureContext` is available through `kernel32.dll` and `ntdll.dll` for x64 and ARM64. Shared `WindowsProcessContext` and `IntegerABI` record the caller’s PC/SP without changing CPU state or LastError. Native Windows observations establish x64 flags `0x10000f`, preservation of untouched home/debug/vector storage, and the legacy 32-bit x87 address fields; ARM64 records PC from LR and clears the saved X0/LR. Register values, SIMD and FP controls come from the guest; x64 selectors and the MXCSR capability mask follow the configured guest CPU. Invalid, unaligned or partly inaccessible destination records fail before publication. `WindowsContextTests.cpp` covers direct imports, provider lookup, VEH callbacks, cross-page output and failure atomicity. `scripts/check_windows_context.py` runs the original executable on Windows x64 and ARM64, with a separate native nonempty-x87 oracle. These ARM64 API observations do not establish native KVM/WHP execution. Context restore, stack walking and dynamic function tables remain separate work. `WindowsProcessServices.def` declares exact module restrictions: the modeled `kernelbase.dll` lookup returns `ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND` (127), matching native observations rather than creating an extra export. [RtlCaptureContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/nf-winnt-rtlcapturecontext).

`WindowsProcessSEH` uses shared `X64SEH` in `os/windows/exception/` (`NeverDEmulationWindowsException`, available without drivers) for x64 `__C_specific_handler` and UNWIND_INFO V1. After VEH search it supports filters, finally callbacks, nonlocal handler transfer, nested/collided dispatch and rebased EXE/DLL frames, preserving nonvolatile GPR/XMM state. Filter continuation runs VCH with the same `CONTEXT`. `WindowsSEHTests.cpp` compares 23 original scenarios with native Windows; KVM/WHP/Unicorn share these semantics. Dispatch rechecks image generations, headers, unwind/scope bytes, personality code regions and IAT bindings under the process budget. Changed metadata or unloaded retained images fail explicitly. ARM64 frame SEH, C++ EH, dynamic function tables, general RtlUnwind/NtContinue, and unwinding across loader/VEH/VCH callback boundaries remain unsupported.

For `EXCEPTION_NONCONTINUABLE`, an x64 filter returning `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION` dispatches `STATUS_NONCONTINUABLE_EXCEPTION` (`0xc0000025`, flags `0x81`, null linked record) with a fresh context. VEH runs again before search restarts on the retained logical stack, preserving finally order and EXE/DLL frame identity under the same depth and execution budgets. The 23 native scenarios include 21 successful executions and two terminations: accepting this secondary exception in VEH/VCH remains unhandled even after restoring the original `CONTEXT`. The model reports that outcome as a runtime failure. Software exception addresses equal their saved PC; internal dispatcher addresses and register layout are model policy. [Windows x64 CI](https://github.com/NeverSight/NeverD/actions/runs/37141166235).

Before dynamic detach callbacks, the module leaves the initialization list while its mapping, name lookup and load/memory list membership remain available. Entry-return oracles observe the initial thread independently of system worker threads.

`WindowsDynamicTests.cpp` compares original x64/ARM64 DLLs and EXEs with independent native Windows observations: reference counts, shared dependencies, nested loading, failed attach cleanup, forwarded lookup, process exit, no-entry DLLs and fresh TLS on reload. Additional regressions reject modified loader metadata and stale code pointers, preserve cumulative preparation budgets and keep interrupted API results incomplete. Windows CI requires the native oracle and WHP cases; cross-compilation and Unicorn ARM64 do not establish native ARM64 execution.

A missing library anywhere in a `GetProcAddress` forwarder chain returns error 127; an explicit `LoadLibrary` of a missing catalogue module returns 126. The native oracle and each available backend assert all 41 declared loader scenarios; return after unloading every DLL is observed 16 times per DLL variant on Windows. Failed initialization in a `GetProcAddress` forwarder also returns 127 after cleanup. Process-detach callbacks preserve the exiting caller’s stack contents.

`WindowsExportTests.cpp` uses original x64/ARM64 DLLs and an EXE to check forwarded code/data/ordinal calls, aliases, initializer queries, rebasing, case-sensitive misses, LastError, cyclic and nonresident targets, invalid pointers and metadata changes after successful queries. The same EXE has an independent native Windows oracle; WHP cases are mandatory in native CI. C ABI/CLI tests compare complete reports. Native ARM64 hardware evidence remains pending. Variants with and without EXE exports cover both dependency graphs, PEB-list order, detach order and name/ordinal/null error codes.

`WindowsLifetimeTests.cpp` compares frozen traces with independent native Windows processes and KVM/WHP/Unicorn execution: normal exit, entry return, both DLL initialization failures, four early exits and DLLs without entry points. It separately checks callback faults, shared budgets, relocated TLS fields and aggregate TLS capacity. The native entry-return probe retains the initial thread handle and checks its exit code and exact thread/process notification sequence in 64 repetitions. Remaining child threads are terminated after observation; their process exit is not treated as the entry return value.

```json
{"windows":{"modules":[{"name":"middle.dll","path":"inputs/middle.dll"},{"name":"leaf.dll","path":"inputs/leaf.dll"}]}}
```

GS on x64 and x18 on ARM64 point to TEB. Supported state includes stack bounds, self pointer, PID/TID, PEB, process parameters, LastError and TLS. Inputs are strict UTF-8 converted to UTF-16; argv is quoted for Microsoft CRT parsing. Environment names are ASCII, case-insensitive duplicates are rejected, values may be Unicode, and the sorted environment is double-NUL terminated. No host environment or filesystem is inherited. Static TLS copies its template, zeroes BSS and writes a 32-bit index; dynamic TLS uses separate TEB slots. Attach and detach read live callback arrays in order, with all instructions and named calls sharing one deadline and resource account. Normal process exit runs detach callbacks. Entry return is supported only with no resident guest DLLs; a second `ExitProcess` during process-exit cleanup remains unsupported.

The exact API inventory is `WindowsProcessServices.def`: `ExitProcess`, `RtlExitUserProcess`, standard-output handles and synchronous `WriteFile`, LastError, process/thread identifiers and pseudo-handles, `GetCommandLineW` / `HeapReAlloc`, process heap allocation/free/size, dynamic TLS and `LoadLibraryA` / `LoadLibraryW` / `FreeLibrary` / `GetModuleHandleA` / `GetModuleHandleW` / `GetProcAddress`. Provider names are restricted to `kernel32.dll`, `kernelbase.dll` and `ntdll.dll` with exact export identity. Direct syscalls and forged callback gates cannot select API models. Heap backing is owned by the process and reclaimed on free. Writes capture binary bytes; Win32 argument errors remain distinct from unsupported asynchronous I/O or user exception dispatch. Pointer aliasing observes the initial completion-count write and the live call-return slot.

The `windows.native_calls` report preserves module/function names, declared scalar arguments and nullable result bits. It does not invent native NT syscall numbers. `NeverDWindowsProcessTests` covers real x64/ARM64 PE startup, compiler TLS, live callback changes, heap/LastError, aliasing, invalid metadata, privilege faults and limits across available backends. `NeverDProcessPublicTests` checks the same PE through CLI/C ABI. Native Windows CI runs the original EXE as an independent behavioral oracle and requires WHP cases; native ARM64 runtime evidence still requires a suitable machine.

`WriteFile` with a nonempty unreadable input buffer returns `ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFER` (1784), zeros the completion count and publishes no bytes.

`windows.defer_unmodeled` loads an image whose loader facts the model does not implement and stops only if execution depends on one. Exports outside the API inventory and modules outside the catalogue bind to opaque entries: each identity resolves to one address, and executing it stops as `unsupported_service` naming `module!export`. Directories the model does not interpret stay uninterpreted, metadata the file does not back is not read at load, and frame-based exception dispatch through such an image stops. `observeProcess` adds a `ProcessObserver` that reads the stopped process at its start and at each execution watch; it cannot change guest state, and ending the run reports `observer`. [Unpacking](unpack.md) is built on both.

zero TLS BSS, install thread pointers and check preserved values across switches.
On x64 they also verify `arch_prctl` errors without losing the previous base.

suite traverses the shared C ABI and CLI and checks report/exit-code agreement.
The static PIE fixtures check relocated auxiliary values and raw zero RELA
slots before performing their own data/function-pointer relocations. Mapping
tests separately retain analysis fixups when that byte source is selected;
dynamic-table tests cover sections being absent and malformed/dependent input.
Anonymous-memory fixtures execute allocation, protection, holes, remapping,
heap growth/shrink and handled syscall errors on both ISAs. Separate actual
guest stores fault after ordinary and partial protection changes. The x64
fixture also rewrites code between RW and RX transitions and calls both
versions at the same address. The same x64 ELF runs natively on Linux as an
independent result/fault oracle. Pure memory tests cover budget exhaustion,
reclamation and authoritative mapping snapshots without retaining RAM.
Cross-compilation and Unicorn ARM64 results are not native ARM64 KVM/WHP evidence.
